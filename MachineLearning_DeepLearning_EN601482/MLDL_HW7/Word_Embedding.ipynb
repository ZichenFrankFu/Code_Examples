The first function `get_similarity` takes two terms in the vocabulary as arguments and returns their semantic similarity (cosine similarity). The second function `show_similar_terms` takes as an argument a term in the vocabulary and shows the top_k most similar terms based on cosine similarity. Use your functions to evaluate similarity of words in the Raven (based on your trained model) and some general words in the pretrained corpus.\n","\n","*Note:* Typically, word embeddings are typically trained on much larger datasets than the ones we provide. You will not necessarily see interpretable similarities below. We are primarily interested in your implementation. Accordingly, we provide code that loads pretrained word embeddings learned using 27 billion tweets.
